# codebuddy2api

Use your **WorkBuddy / CodeBuddy (Tencent)** subscription as local **OpenAI- and Anthropic-compatible APIs**.

[中文文档](README.zh-CN.md)

- Chat Completions, Responses and Anthropic Messages, with tool calling and streaming.
- Built-in **WebUI** for browser login, models, credentials, logs and settings — no desktop client required.
- Automatic multi-account routing across domestic and international sites, with credential refresh.
- Per-account automation: domestic check-in then Buddy travel by default, with independent switches; international check-in is opt-in.

## Quick start

Requires Git and Docker Compose. The prebuilt GHCR image includes the WebUI; no local build is needed.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/maiphucgiang/codebuddy2api.git
cd codebuddy2api
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env`: set `CODEBUDDY2API_KEY` to your own random key and pick the image. Preserve an existing `.env` on upgrades:

```dotenv
CODEBUDDY2API_IMAGE=ghcr.io/maiphucgiang/codebuddy2api:latest
```

```bash
docker compose pull
docker compose up -d --no-build
```

`latest` tracks stable releases; pin a published version tag for reproducible deployments. Image features belong to that version, not to unmerged source branches.

First use:

1. Open **http://127.0.0.1:8787/dashboard** and sign in with your API key.
2. In **Credentials**, add a domestic or international account through browser login, or import an `.info` file.
3. In **Models**, find an available model and use its public ID in your client.

The template binds to localhost only. Configure HTTPS and restrict network access before allowing remote connections; keep and securely back up the `auth/` data directory. To run current source or log in from a terminal instead, see the [deployment guide](docs/deployment.md).

## Client setup

| Protocol | Base URL |
|----------|----------|
| OpenAI Chat / Responses | `http://127.0.0.1:8787/v1` |
| Anthropic Messages | `http://127.0.0.1:8787` |

- **API key:** the same key used to sign in to the WebUI.
- **Model:** a public ID from the WebUI or `GET /v1/models`.
- All accounts share these URLs; no region parameter is needed. Anthropic SDKs append `/v1/messages` themselves, so leave it out of the Base URL.

## FAQ

- **WebUI sign-in fails behind an HTTPS domain/reverse proxy?** Trust your public origin via `admin_allowed_origins` — see [Management Origin checks](docs/advanced.md#management-origin--csrf-switch).
- **No Docker?** After installing dependencies and the WebUI, run `uv run converter.py` or `python3 converter.py` without `.env`. First local startup saves a default key and displays it once — see [Local Python setup](docs/deployment.md#local-python-setup).
- **Where is my data?** Everything lives in `auth/` (or `/data/auth` in Docker): credentials, settings and log databases — see [Data and backups](docs/webui.md#data-and-backups).
- **Which image tag should I use?** `latest` follows stable releases, `edge` follows main, version tags pin one release — see [Published images](docs/deployment.md#use-published-images).
- **Responses tool output/arguments compressed or need verbatim passthrough?** Set `responses_projection_mode` (default `balanced`, or `passthrough` to disable projection) and `responses_projection_max_bytes` (default `40000`, `0` disables per-item trimming). Balanced trimming keeps the head/tail and reports original bytes, estimated tokens and total lines; client addresses stay unchanged — see [Responses projection](docs/clients.md#responses-projection) and [details](docs/advanced.md#responses-projection).
